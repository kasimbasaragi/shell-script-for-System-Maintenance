System Maintenance
I often use a little Linux shell script to upgrade my system instead of doing it manually. The below simple shell script will show you how to do this.
The script also takes care of old packages that are no longer needed. You need to run this script using sudo else it will not work properly.
i am using rhel machine so i use command for update packages "yum"
